1. controllers/: Store controller files that contain business logic and handle HTTP requests and responses.
2. models/: Keep database models here if your project involves a database. These models define how data is structured in your application.
3. middleware/: Place middleware functions, which are functions that can process requests before they reach route handlers.
4. routes/: Define route files to separate different API endpoints or web routes. This keeps your code modular and easy to maintain.
5. .env (Optional): Consider including a .env file to manage environment variables such as API keys and sensitive information. This file should be kept out of version control for security reasons.
6. server.js (or app.js): This file serves as the entry point for your Node.js and Express application. It sets up the server and defines the server logic.
7. Static Assets (Optional): If your application serves static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images, you can create a directory for them (e.g., public/ or static/) to keep them separate from your application logic.
